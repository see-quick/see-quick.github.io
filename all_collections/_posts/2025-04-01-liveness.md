*We proved nothing bad ever happens. But does anything good ever happen?*

In [Part 14](https://see-quick.github.io/posts/safety/), we explored safety properties: those that make sure our system doesn't enter a bad state. 
But what about the opposite?

What if we want to ensure that:
- A message is eventually delivered
- A file is eventually replicated
- A philosopher eventually eats

These are liveness properties.

## ⏳ What is Liveness?

Liveness properties capture the idea of progress. 
They say:
> **“Something good will eventually happen.”**

Unlike safety (where one bad state breaks the guarantee), liveness can’t be violated in a single step. 
It’s only violated if the good thing never happens — no matter how long we wait.

Examples of Liveness:
- "Every request eventually gets a response"
- "Every lock is eventually released"
- "Every philosopher eventually gets to eat"

### Liveness vs Safety (basic overview)

| 🧠 Property      | 🛡️ Safety                           | ⏳ Liveness                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Focus**        | Preventing bad things from happening | Ensuring good things eventually happen |
| **Violation**    | Happens in a single bad state        | Happens when something *never* happens |
| **Typical Form** | “This must never happen”             | “This must eventually happen”          |
| **Example**      | “Never two leaders at once”          | “Eventually, a leader is elected”      |

## ⌚ Temporal Logic: Reasoning Over Time

Classical logic — using predicates like `x > 0` or `isLocked = false` — is powerful, but it's fundamentally timeless. 
It tells us what is true now, in a single instant. 
But systems don't just exist in the now — they evolve. 
They move from state to state.

This is especially true in concurrent or distributed systems, where behavior spans across time: 
requests are sent and later responded to, locks are acquired and eventually released, messages are delivered (hopefully) eventually.

To reason about these systems, we need a richer logic — one that understands time.
That’s where **temporal logic** comes in.
It allows us to describe not just what must be true, but when it must be true.

### ⏳ Temporal Logic Operators (in LTL)

| Operator | Name       | Description                             |
|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `□φ`     | Globally   | φ holds in all future states            |
| `◇φ`     | Eventually | φ will hold at some point in the future |
| `◯φ`     | Next       | φ holds in the next state               |
| ...      | ...        | ...                                     |

These operators allow us to describe how a system behaves across all possible executions over time.
There are many more temporal logics like `Computation Tree Logic` (CTL), which has branching timelines (many futures)
instead of one linear line of time. 
Moreover, it adds path quantifiers (i.e., `A` = "for all futures"
and`E` = "there exists a future"). 
So one could create temporal property *"On all paths, if hungry, then eventually eating"*,
 which can be written as `AG (hungry → AF eat)`. 
Furthermore, we also know CTL* which is superset of both LTL and CTL and can freely combine path quantifiers and temporal operators
But in my personal practice I met with mostly **LTL logic**.

## 🌟 Temporal Logic in TLA+ and Quint

### TLA+
- TLA+ uses `[]` (always) and `<>` (eventually)
- Mixes *state predicates* (what's true now) and *actions* (what can change)
- Example:
  ```
  [] (x < 10)       // Always true
  <> (x = 42)       // Eventually x becomes 42
  []<>(x = 0)       // Infinitely often, x = 0
  ```

### Quint
- Quint supports `always`, `eventually` and more which I assume maps to TLA+ operators (i.e., `[]`, `<>`, ...)
- Temporal formulas can be used directly in the model:
  ```quint
  temporal Liveness = always(eventually(x == 42))
  temporal Liveness2 = x == 0 leadsTo x == 1
  ```

Fairness plays a critical role in verifying **liveness properties**. 
Without fairness, a model checker might find counterexamples where an action is enabled forever but simply never chosen — an unrealistic execution that violates liveness only because of unfair scheduling.

Fairness assumptions help rule out such pathological behaviors:
- **Weak fairness** says: if an action is continuously enabled, it must eventually occur.
- **Strong fairness** says: if an action is enabled infinitely often, it must eventually occur.

These assumptions let us model real-world schedulers more accurately, where starvation is not tolerated.

## 🔌 A Minimal Liveness Example (with Fairness)

Let’s go back to our trusty **Light Switch** model.

```quint
var isOn: bool

action init = all { isOn' = false }
action turnOn = all { isOn' = true }
action turnOff = all { isOn' = false }
action step = any { turnOn, turnOff }
```

Without fairness, the system might *stutter* forever in the same state.

### Liveness Without Fairness
```quint
temporal Liveness = always(eventually(isOn))
```
This might fail! If the system just never chooses `turnOn`, `isOn` never becomes true.

### Weak Fairness to the Rescue
```quint
temporal WeakFairStep = weakFair(step, isOn)
temporal WeakLiveness = WeakFairStep implies always(eventually(isOn))
```
Now if `step` is always enabled, it must eventually happen — and the light must turn on.

### Strong Fairness
To ensure toggling on/off forever:
```quint
temporal StrongFairStep =
  strongFair(turnOn, isOn) and strongFair(turnOff, isOn)

// Liveness: light toggles forever
temporal StrongLiveness =
  StrongFairStep implies always(eventually(isOn and eventually(not(isOn))))
```

## ☕ Example: Dining Philosophers & Starvation

In the [Dining Philosophers](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint/blob/main/examples/classic/distributed/DiningPhilosophers/DiningPhilosophers5.qnt) model:

We define **deadlock** as a state where all philosophers are hungry but no one can pick up forks.

```quint
temporal DeadlockProperty = eventually(deadlockCondition)
```

To ensure the system never gets stuck, we use fairness:
```quint
temporal DeadlockFreedom = weakFair(step, vars) implies always(eventually(not(deadlockCondition)))
```

Want more? We can even define **starvation freedom**:
```quint
temporal StarvationFreedom = weakFair(step, vars) implies philosophers.forall(p => eventually(states.get(p) == Eating))
```

## Closing thoughts...

Firstly, let’s recap what we’ve learned in this blog post:
- **Safety** ensures that nothing bad ever happens — your system stays within well-defined boundaries.
- **Liveness** guarantees that something good eventually happens — your system doesn’t just sit there; it progresses.
- **Fairness** helps unlock liveness by ensuring that enabled actions aren’t indefinitely ignored — preventing starvation and ensuring opportunity.

Together, they form a complete picture of correctness over time.  
And temporal logic gives us the language to express these ideas with mathematical precision.  
Tools like **Quint** let us turn these ideas into executable specifications we can simulate, verify, and reason about — before writing any code.

In the next post, we’ll explore `model-based testing with Quint` — a powerful way to **bridge the gap between your specification and your implementation**.
We’ll see how Quint models can become more than just proofs of correctness — they can drive the generation of test cases, uncover edge cases, and keep your implementation in sync with your design.
Because in real-world systems, correctness isn’t just about being *safe* — it’s about staying aligned over time.

Until then, may your systems be not just correct... but eventually correct. ✨
