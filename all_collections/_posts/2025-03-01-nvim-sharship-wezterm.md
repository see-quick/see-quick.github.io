If you're looking to level up your development environment, combining Neovim (nvim) 📝, Starship 🚀, and WezTerm 💻 can give you a powerful, highly customizable, and visually appealing workflow. 
In this blog post, I’ll walk you through my setup, configurations, and how you can achieve a seamless coding experience. 🎯

## ✨ Neovim – The Ultimate Text Editor

Neovim is a modern take on Vim, offering better extensibility, performance, and built-in LSP (i.e., [Language Server Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol)) support 🔥.
Whether you’re debugging, navigating large codebases, or writing in multiple languages, Neovim’s plugin ecosystem makes it a powerhouse.

⚙️ My Neovim Config: [Github link](https://github.com/see-quick/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim)

🔥 Features:
- 🕵️‍♂️ Telescope – Fuzzy finder for quick file and text search.
- 🛠️ Built-in LSP – Get IDE-like autocompletion and inline diagnostics.
- 🐞 Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) – Debug your code inside Neovim!
- 🎨 Theming – Beautiful colorschemes for a modern look.
- 🔹 Here’s an example of using Telescope for fuzzy finding:
